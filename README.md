### Abstract

This paper argues that UK higher education faces a ‘lemons market’ problem: information asymmetries created by opaque rankings providers and policy think tanks distort market signals, misprice systemic risk, and undermine resilience. Drawing on Akerlof’s theory of information failure and the lessons of the 2008 financial crisis, it shows how organisations such as HEPI and Times Higher Education replicate the conflicts of interest once endemic in credit rating agencies. Their outputs influence public policy, investor confidence, and institutional financial strategies, yet operate without robust disclosure, fiduciary duties, or independent oversight. The paper advances a reform agenda based on fiduciary openness, methodological transparency, stress testing, and parliamentary scrutiny insulated from capture. It concludes that UK higher education requires its own equivalent of post-2008 ratings reform to restore credibility and systemic resilience.
