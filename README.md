### Abstract

UK higher education exhibits a classic ‘lemons market’ problem: information asymmetry distorts signals of quality and risk, mispricing systemic fragility across a £200bn loan book and £40bn tuition market. OECD data show England as an outlier in its dependence on private fees and international students, heightening exposure to geopolitical and currency shocks. Yet the key intermediaries shaping policy and investor confidence — HEPI and _Times Higher Education_ — operate with opaque governance and conflicts of interest akin to credit rating agencies before 2008. Their outputs influence bond prospectuses, financial statements, and government policy, but without fiduciary safeguards or oversight. Just as post-crisis finance required ratings reform, higher education now needs fiduciary openness, transparency of methodology, and capture-resistant regulation to restore credibility and resilience.
